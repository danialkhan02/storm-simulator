Disaster Simulator:

Used Python to develop a disaster simulator which, given a specific catastrophe (hurricane, tornado, etc…) and
population/population-density, will simulate the number of deaths and injuries over time.
● Used the PyGame library to graph deaths and injuries over time.
● Once the situation has finished, will give a final update on the number of injuries/deaths and the cost of damage.

->use sprites to display graphical representations of settings
